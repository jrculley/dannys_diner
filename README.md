My attempt at solving Data with Danny using mysql.

## Problem Statement

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program.
Additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided 3 tables worth of data about his customers. The Scehma is found below.

## Case Study Solutions.

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?** 
```SQL
SELECT 
	sales.customer_id,
	SUM(menu.price) as amt_spent
FROM sales
LEFT JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id;
```
  
In order to find the amount spent by each customer we had to join sales table that showed what items each customer purchased and join to it the menu table that listed the price for each item. We then sumed up the amount spent for each customer.

|customer_id | amt_spent|
|---|---|
|A | 76|
|B | 74|
|C | 36|

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant? **
```SQL
SELECT
	customer_id,
	count(distinct order_date) as Visit_QTY
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
```
Here we just are referencing the sales table and are counting the distinct dates that each customer purchased an item. We use distinct because if a customer ordered 2 items on the same date, it would count as 2 visits rather than 1. 

|customer_id | Visit_QTY|
|---|---|
|A|	4|
|B|	6|
|C|	2|

**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**
```SQL
WITH CTE AS (
	SELECT
		Sales.customer_id,
		menu.product_name, 
		RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY sales.customer_id ORDER BY sales.order_date) AS num
	FROM sales 
		JOIN menu
			ON sales.product_id=menu.product_id
	)
SELECT DISTINCT customer_id, product_name
FROM CTE
WHERE num=1;
```

**4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**
```SQL
SELECT 
	menu.product_name,
	count(sales.product_id) as num_purchas
FROM SALES
INNER JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY menu.product_name
ORDER BY count(sales.product_id) desc
LIMIT 1;
```

**5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?**
```SQL	
WITH CTE AS (
	SELECT
		Sales.customer_id,
        	sales.product_id,
		count(product_id) id_count,
		RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY sales.customer_id ORDER BY count(sales.product_id)) AS num_ordered
	FROM sales 
	GROUP BY sales.customer_id , sales.product_id
	)
SELECT
	cte.customer_id,
        menu.product_name
FROM cte
INNER JOIN menu ON cte.product_id=menu.product_id
WHERE num_ordered = 1;
```
    
**6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**
```SQL
WITH CTE AS (
	SELECT 
		sales.customer_id,
        	sales.product_id,
        	sales.order_date,
        	members.join_date,
        	RANK() OVER (partition by sales.customer_id order by sales.order_date) as ordered
	FROM sales
	INNER JOIN members on sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
    WHERE sales.order_date > members.join_date)
SELECT 
	cte.customer_id,
        menu.product_name
FROM CTE
INNER JOIN menu ON cte.product_id = menu.product_id
WHERE ordered=1
ORDER BY cte.customer_id;
```

**7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**
```SQL
WITH CTE AS (
	SELECT 
		sales.customer_id,
        	sales.product_id,
        	sales.order_date,
        	members.join_date,
        	RANK() OVER (partition by sales.customer_id order by sales.order_date) as ordered
	FROM sales
	INNER JOIN members on sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
   	WHERE sales.order_date < members.join_date)
SELECT 
	cte.customer_id,
        menu.product_name
FROM CTE
INNER JOIN menu ON cte.product_id = menu.product_id
WHERE ordered=1
ORDER BY cte.customer_id;
```
    
**8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**
```SQL
SELECT
	sales.customer_id,
	count(sales.product_id) as items,
	sum(menu.price) as spent
FROM sales
INNER JOIN members on sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
INNER JOIN menu on sales.product_id = menu.product_id
WHERE sales.order_date < members.join_date
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
```

**9.  If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?**
```SQL
WITH Tpoints as (
	SELECT
    		menu.product_id,
    		CASE
			when menu.product_id = 1 then menu.price*20
        		ELSE menu.price*10
		END AS points
	FROM menu ) 
SELECT
	sales.customer_id,
        sum(tpoints.points) as total_points
FROM sales
INNER JOIN tpoints ON sales.product_id = tpoints.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id;
```

**10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?**
```SQL
WITH purchased AS (
	SELECT
    		sales.customer_id,
   		sales.product_id,
    		sales.order_date,
    		members.join_date,
    		CASE
			when sales.order_date between members.join_date and date_add(members.join_date, interval 7 day) or menu.product_id = 1 then menu.price*20
        		ELSE menu.price*10
		END AS points
	FROM sales
	INNER JOIN menu on sales.product_id = menu.product_id
	INNER JOIN members on sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
	WHERE sales.order_date <= '2021-01-31')
SELECT
	customer_id,
    	sum(points)
FROM purchased
GROUP BY customer_id;
```
